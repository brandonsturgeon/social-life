<p>Homeowners, landlords, and tenants alike point to those neglecting up-keep of their property as a major reason why a neighborhood becomes a ghetto. Many do their fair share to maintain the character of the neighborhood. They believe it’s unfair that others are not accepting their neighborly responsibility to maintain their property.</p>

<p>The city also must contribute their fair share of maintenance and improvements in this neighborhood. As one of the largest single property owners, the city has a large stake in this neighborhood’s decline to a ghetto.</p>

<h3 class="pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out">The most predictable reason for the lack in public investment is lack of money.</h3>

<p>Perhaps the lack of money results from having mostly low-income residents. Maybe it’s the lack of private investments generating tax revenues via development fees. In either case, residents are often encouraged to attract families of higher incomes to create a more “mixed income” neighborhood. These developments are said to “increase the tax base” and “stabilize the neighborhood.”</p>

<h2 class="mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid">Will low-income neighborhoods ever have enough to warrant improvements? Must low-income neighborhoods depend on external investors to be able to justify desired public improvements? </h2>
<h1 class="f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid">How bad of a public investment is this neighborhood?</h1>

<h1 class="f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid">It’s the best public investment in town.</h1>

<h2 class="mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid">Where’s the return on investment for residents?</h2>

<p>If looking for mega-projects as evidence of private investment, none will be found in this neighborhood. It’s already built out and inhabited by many residents. Mega-projects won’t be popping up like they will in the less developed Telegraph, Railyard, and South Haymarket districts.</p>

<h3 class="pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out">Despite the lack of mega-projects, private investments are still made here.</h3>

<p>Many private investments are being made by residents, homeowners, landlords, and small businesses. They’re starting new businesses, altering interiors to serve customers better, creating new entertainment events and festivals, restoring older buildings to preserve their historic heritage, improving private properties to provide community-owned public spaces, and making many other small to moderate investments that are within their means.</p>

<p>These may seem trivial compared to the public investments needed for mega-projects like parking garages and stadiums. However, just like the many small private investments in the neighborhood,</p>

<h2 class="mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid">small public investments add up to large community impact.</h2>
