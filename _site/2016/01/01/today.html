<p>There is a mismatch between how this neighborhood is characterized and how people of this neighborhood perceive themselves.</p>

<p>Today there’s a perception this neighborhood is in a tailspin of crime and decline. There’s a sense of urgency to improve this neighborhood with new developments before it hits rock bottom.</p>

<p>However, after extended observations, active listening, and engaged participation, many doubts are rising about this narrative of decline.</p>

<p>Today, extended observations show more locally-owned businesses popping up or making targeted investments in the interior of their small shops. Active listening hears many stories of past house shows for music, art, and media followed with civic discourse. Engaged participation is revealing new community-owned space for anything from discussions of prose to neighbors sewing clothes, all with a motivational “Do-It-Ourselves” attitude.</p>

<p>Today, people of this neighborhood know about the perception of the crime; the ghetto; the poverty; the apathy. Yet, today, there’s something about this neighborhood that makes them show up to family game nights with 200 other neighbors; something about this neighborhood makes them bullish on their small business’ future; something about this neighborhood makes them committed to literally planting roots in their community.</p>

<p>This confusion prompts the question, how is this neighborhood and its people characterized? How well do these characterizations match how people of this neighborhood actually perceive their own lives? What, if anything, can be learned and shared about the perceptions that can benefit the people of this neighborhood.</p>

<p>Through interviews, observations, meetings, articles, conversations, art, literature review, stories, focus groups, recess, translations, friendship, field studies, people watching, collaborations, data diving, and even some eavesdropping, this report examines some of the most common characterizations this neighborhood faces today.</p>

<p>The thoughts, fears, frustrations, anxieties, hopes, motivations, aspirations, and values coming from people of this neighborhood are explored and compared to the characterizations placed upon them.</p>
