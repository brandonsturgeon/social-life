        <description>&lt;p&gt;If this neighborhood has an average crime rate, and if it’s one of the best public investments in town, and if displacement of its residents won’t solve poverty, and if its residents actually do care; why do these false neighborhood characterizations continue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;If you go looking for failure, you’re bound to find it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have been looking too long and too hard for failure in this neighborhood. This approach is used so commonly, even some residents now look for what’s wrong with their own neighborhood. Their questions continually ask what’s wrong in this neighborhood, rather than what’s strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;Perhaps the most important contributor to a community’s success is a belief in its abilities rather than its problems.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;- John Mcknight, &lt;em class=&quot;ttu f5 fw3&quot;&gt;Professor Emeritus of Social Policy, Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of this neighborhood need approaches that ask better questions if they want to find better answers for their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;Current approaches to evaluating neighborhoods are insufficient.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents agree this neighborhood should be walkable, but this neighborhood is already one of the most walkable neighborhoods in the Lincoln. Tracking progress with walkability doesn’t provide much insight about this neighborhood’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln’s comprehensive land-use plan (LPlan 2040) points to Lincoln’s Community Indicators for useful benchmarks. Lincoln Community Indicators report measures of well-being and progress, however, its focus is primarily city-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Lincoln Community Indicator 27 for the affordable housing benchmark is the median price of a single-family detached home. Yet, most residents rent their homes in this neighborhood. The Lincoln’s Community Indicator report may completely miss the rising costs for residents living here; it doesn’t capture the local context of this neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is success at the neighborhood level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;neighborhood success  = &lt;br /&gt;  when people choose to stay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word choose is emphasized because many residents are not staying here by choice. They are staying because there’s little else they could afford. Many would move out of the neighborhood if they were allowed to or when they have the means to do so; in some cases, simply to be closer to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why will people choose to stay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;People stay for a Social &lt;b class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/h1&gt;

        <title>Poverty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Lincoln Vital Signs report identified more Lincoln neighborhoods in extreme poverty, than in 2010. Indeed, residents noted not making enough money to keep up with rising costs of living. Some are looking for more income opportunities or awaiting more affordable housing options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also warns against children living in poverty for an extended period of time. These children face tougher odds for achievement than do other children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw10 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;Gentrification may improve the poverty situation in the neighborhood.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say gentrification will provide more housing opportunities and help stabilize the schools in this neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these positive outcomes, some residents voiced concerns about the consequences of gentrification such as displacement of longtime residents. They believe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw10 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;displacement will have negative impacts on residents and small businesses.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid mb0&quot;&gt;Are residents at-risk of losing their homes if there’s not any cost stabilization mechanisms for renters? Where will residents live if they are displaced from this neighborhood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;What impact will displacement have on the residents of this neighborhood?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;Residents did not create the poverty they are living in.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2010 is the first year after economists suggest the Great Recession ended in the US. Yet, the buying power of money has continued to decline. A resident makes less money today even if working the same hours and earning the same hourly wage since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw10 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;$100 today would only buy $90 worth of groceries 5 years ago.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some landlords are raising rents to try to compensate for the inflation. Many families in this neighborhood are having a harder time keeping up. The level of wages required to make a living is rising beyond reach. This issue persists even after a state increase of the minimum wage to $9 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economics of this neighborhood is a major reason why families come to live here. The changing economics is also a major reason why families may have to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;The stability of this neighborhood depends on how livable remains for its families.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Ghetto</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Homeowners, landlords, and tenants alike point to those neglecting up-keep of their property as a major reason why a neighborhood becomes a ghetto. Many do their fair share to maintain the character of the neighborhood. They believe it’s unfair that others are not accepting their neighborly responsibility to maintain their property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city also must contribute their fair share of maintenance and improvements in this neighborhood. As one of the largest single property owners, the city has a large stake in this neighborhood’s decline to a ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;The most predictable reason for the lack in public investment is lack of money.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the lack of money results from having mostly low-income residents. Maybe it’s the lack of private investments generating tax revenues via development fees. In either case, residents are often encouraged to attract families of higher incomes to create a more “mixed income” neighborhood. These developments are said to “increase the tax base” and “stabilize the neighborhood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;Will low-income neighborhoods ever have enough to warrant improvements? Must low-income neighborhoods depend on external investors to be able to justify desired public improvements? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;How bad of a public investment is this neighborhood?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;It’s the best public investment in town.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;Where’s the return on investment for residents?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If looking for mega-projects as evidence of private investment, none will be found in this neighborhood. It’s already built out and inhabited by many residents. Mega-projects won’t be popping up like they will in the less developed Telegraph, Railyard, and South Haymarket districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw6 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;Despite the lack of mega-projects, private investments are still made here.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many private investments are being made by residents, homeowners, landlords, and small businesses. They’re starting new businesses, altering interiors to serve customers better, creating new entertainment events and festivals, restoring older buildings to preserve their historic heritage, improving private properties to provide community-owned public spaces, and making many other small to moderate investments that are within their means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These may seem trivial compared to the public investments needed for mega-projects like parking garages and stadiums. However, just like the many small private investments in the neighborhood,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;small public investments add up to large community impact.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Crime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking over the chuckles in the audience, he leaned into the microphone and continued with a joke referring to residents of this neighborhood as “witnesses” or “perpetrators” of crime scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who do not live here, and even a few who do, often call out this neighborhood for its high crime. The emcee’s jokes show just how negative a perception many people have about this neighborhood and its residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many residents do not share this perception. They believe the negative perceptions of safety in this neighborhood are exaggerated or even flat-out wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;I walk through [this neighborhood] all the time and nothing bad has ever happened to me. We could use some better lighting at night, but I don’t think it’s as dangerous as they say it is.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt; -A Neighbor&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some feel the local media over-report crime happening in this neighborhood. Some feel biases toward ethnicity and class are contributing to the negative perceptions as has been proven in national media. Many residents suggest higher population density as the main reason why the number of crimes reported are higher here than other Lincoln neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid mb0&quot;&gt;Which perception of this neighborhood is correct? Does the amount of people living have an impact on crime?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;f2 f-subheadline-ns mt0 lh-solid&quot;&gt;Is this neighborhood as crime-infested as some say it is?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f2 f3-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;Perception is the problem, not crime.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy solutions to stop contributions to negative perception don’t exist. Negative perceptions towards ethnicity and class still plague neighborhood-focused apps like AirBnb and Nextdoor while they try to curb racial profiling. The local media will always report on sensational crimes and little else on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it’s not crime alone creating negative perceptions of this neighborhood. Downtown has comparable crime rates, but is still able to create a positive narrative and attract investors. It does so by regularly and publicly sharing what is great about their neighborhood rather than what’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;pv4 bt bb b--black-70 black-70 mw10 center f3 f2-ns fw3 call-out&quot;&gt;Positive perceptions can crowd out negative ones.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This neighborhood must express its own positive stories too, both publicly and regularly. Media is not solely responsible, residents must also stop contributing to the negative perceptions of safety in their neighborhood. They shouldn’t expect others to do so before they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid&quot;&gt;The change in perception must start with the residents.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a mismatch between how this neighborhood is characterized and how people of this neighborhood perceive themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there’s a perception this neighborhood is in a tailspin of crime and decline. There’s a sense of urgency to improve this neighborhood with new developments before it hits rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after extended observations, active listening, and engaged participation, many doubts are rising about this narrative of decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, extended observations show more locally-owned businesses popping up or making targeted investments in the interior of their small shops. Active listening hears many stories of past house shows for music, art, and media followed with civic discourse. Engaged participation is revealing new community-owned space for anything from discussions of prose to neighbors sewing clothes, all with a motivational “Do-It-Ourselves” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, people of this neighborhood know about the perception of the crime; the ghetto; the poverty; the apathy. Yet, today, there’s something about this neighborhood that makes them show up to family game nights with 200 other neighbors; something about this neighborhood makes them bullish on their small business’ future; something about this neighborhood makes them committed to literally planting roots in their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confusion prompts the question, how is this neighborhood and its people characterized? How well do these characterizations match how people of this neighborhood actually perceive their own lives? What, if anything, can be learned and shared about the perceptions that can benefit the people of this neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through interviews, observations, meetings, articles, conversations, art, literature review, stories, focus groups, recess, translations, friendship, field studies, people watching, collaborations, data diving, and even some eavesdropping, this report examines some of the most common characterizations this neighborhood faces today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thoughts, fears, frustrations, anxieties, hopes, motivations, aspirations, and values coming from people of this neighborhood are explored and compared to the characterizations placed upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
