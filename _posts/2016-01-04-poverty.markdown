The 2014 Lincoln Vital Signs report identified more Lincoln neighborhoods in extreme poverty, than in 2010. Indeed, residents noted not making enough money to keep up with rising costs of living. Some are looking for more income opportunities or awaiting more affordable housing options.

The report also warns against children living in poverty for an extended period of time. These children face tougher odds for achievement than do other children.

Some say gentrification will provide more housing opportunities and help stabilize the schools in this neighborhood.

Despite these positive outcomes, some residents voiced concerns about the consequences of gentrification such as displacement of longtime residents. They believe

The year 2010 is the first year after economists suggest the Great Recession ended in the US. Yet, the buying power of money has continued to decline. A resident makes less money today even if working the same hours and earning the same hourly wage since 2010.

Some landlords are raising rents to try to compensate for the inflation. Many families in this neighborhood are having a harder time keeping up. The level of wages required to make a living is rising beyond reach. This issue persists even after a state increase of the minimum wage to $9 per hour.

The economics of this neighborhood is a major reason why families come to live here. The changing economics is also a major reason why families may have to leave.
